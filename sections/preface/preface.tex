\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Course Description}

\textbf{MAT 738  Introduction to Algebraic Geometry}: The study of the zeros of polynomials. Classical algebraic varieties in affine and projective space, followed by introduction to modern theory of sheaves, schemes, and cohomology.


\subsection{Disclaimer}

These notes were taken in Spring 2019 in a course taught by Professor Steven Diaz. In some places, notation/material has been changed or added. Any errors in this text should be attributed to the typist -- Caleb McWhorter -- and not the instructor or any referenced text. 


\subsection{Conventions}

Although some results in these notes can be generalized to arbitrary fields, we assume throughout that all fields mentioned are algebraically closed, unless otherwise noted. When arbitrary rings are mentioned, they are assumed to be commutative and possess an identity. All ring homomorphisms $\phi: R \to S$ are assumed to have the property that $\phi(1_R)=1_S$. For a ring $R$, the whole ring is considered to be an ideal, but not a prime ideal.
