\subsection{Disclaimer}

These notes were taken in Spring 2019 in a course taught by Professor Steven Diaz. In some places, notation/material has been changed or added. Any errors in this text should be attributed to the typist -- Caleb McWhorter -- and not the instructor or any referenced text. 


\subsection{Conventions}

A ring is a commutative ring with identity---unless otherwise stated. All ring homomorphisms $\phi: R \to S$ are assumed to have the property that $\phi(1_R)=1_S$. For a ring $R$, the whole ring is considered to be an ideal, but not a prime ideal.
