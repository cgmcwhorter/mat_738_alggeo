\subsection{Introduction}

Graded rings first.

\begin{dfn}[Grading]
Let $R$ be a ring. A grading of $R$ is an expression of the additive group $(R,+)$ as an interal direct sum $R= \oplus_{i=1}^\infty R_i$ with the property that if $a \in R_d, b \in R_e$, then $ab \in R_{e+d}$, written $R_e \cdot R_d \subseteq R_{de}$. A graded ring is a ring together with a given grading. An element of $R_d$ is said to be homogeneous of degree $d$. 
\end{dfn}


\begin{ex}
Let $R= k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. $R_i= \{ f \in R \colon \text{all monomials of }f\text{ having deg }i\} \cup \{0\}$, is homogenous of every degree. $\C[x,y]$, $x^2+4xy-17y^2$ is homogeneous of degree 2. $x^3-xy$ is not homogeneous. \xqed
\end{ex}


\begin{rem}
You can replace $\oplus_{i=0}^\infty R_i$ with $\oplus_{i \in M} R_i$, where $M$ is any monoid. We say the case of $\Z$ is $\Z$-grading. 
\end{rem}


Let $R$ be a graded ring. Each $f \in R$ has a unique expression $f= f_0 + \cdots + f_d$, where $f_i$ is homogeneous of degree $i$---simply the definition of a direct sum. 


















Definition and prop (homogeneous graded ideal)


\begin{prop}
Let $R$ be a graded ring and $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $I$ can be generated by homogeneous elements
\item $I= \oplus_{i=0}^\infty (I \cap R_i)$ as a group
\item given $f \in R$, write $f= f_0 + \cdots + f_d$, where $f_i$ is homogeneous of degree $i$. Then $f \in I$ if and only if all $f_i \in I$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\pf (b) if and only if (c) definition of direct sum. In (c), note that all $f_i \in I$ certainly $f \in I$. The only things to check is $f \in I$, then $f_i \in I$. (c) to (a): write every $f \in I$ as $f= f_0 + \cdots + f_d$, where $f_i$ is homogeneous of degree $i$. Certainly, $I$ is generated by all the $f_i$ that appear as $f$ varies over all $f \in I$. (a) to (c): Say $I$ is generated by $\{f_\alpha\}$, $\alpha \in A$, where $f_\alpha$ is homogenous of degree $d_\alpha$. Choose $F \in I$, then $F= \sum_{i=1}^n a_i f_{\alpha_i}$. Write $F= F_0 + \cdots + F_d$, where $F_j$ is homogeneous of degree $j$. What is $F_j$ in terms of the expression?
	\[
	F_j= \sum_{i=1}^n ((\text{deg }j - \text{deg}(f_{\alpha_i})) \text{ piece of }a_i) f_{\alpha_i \in I}. 
	\] \qed \\


\begin{prop}
Let $R$ be a graded ring.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if $I, J$ are homogeneous ideals, then so are $I+J$, $IJ$, $I \cap J$, and $\sqrt{J}$
\item let $I$ be a homogeneous ideal. Then $I$ is prime if and only if for any two homogeneous elements $f,g \in R$, if $fg \in I$ then either $f \in I$ or $g \in I$. 
\item if $f,g \in R$, and integral domain, with $f,g$ nonzero, then $fg$ is homogeneous if and only if $f,g$ are homogeneous. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}


\pf 

$f= f_0 + \cdots + f_d$, $g= g_0 + \cdots+ g_e$
$fg= (f_dg_e) + (f_{d-1}g_e+ f_dg_{e-1}) + \cdots$
If all $f_i \in I$, then $F \in I$ and we are done.
If all $g_i \in I$, then $g \in I$ and we are done.
So assume that $f_i \notin I$ and some $g_j \notin I$.
Let $s$ be the largest number such that $f_s \notin I$ and let $t$ be the largest number such that $g_t \notin I$. We examine the degree $s+t$ piece of $fg$ as $fg \in I$ and $I$ is homogeneous, it is in $I$. It will have the form $f_sg_t+$ terms of the form $f_ig_j$ with either $i>s$ or $j>t$. All of these extra terms are in $I$, the whole sum is in the ideal. Thus, $f_sg_t \in I$ then either $f_s \in I$ or $g_t \in I$, a contradiction. \qed \\


For a homogeneous ideal $I$ of $R$, we often denote $I \cap R_i$ by $I_i$. It then follows that 
	\[
	R/I \cong \dfrac{\oplus R_i}{\oplus I_i} \cong \oplus_{i=0}^\infty R_i/I_i.
	\]
Thus, $R/I$ is naturally a graded ring with $(R/I)_i = R_i/I_i$. Now suppose $R$ is a noetherian graded ring and $I \subset R$ is a homogeneous ideal. We know $I$ can be generated by homogeneous ideal because it is homogeneous. Because $R$ is noetherian, $I$ can be generated by finitely many elements. Can it be generated by finitely many homogeneous elements? Indeed, this is the case. If you set up the proof of the ACC then every ideal is f.g., you can prove ACC then every set of generators for an ideal has a finite subset that generates. 



Now for projective space, you may have heard `parallel lines meet at infinity'. 

% Give image of parallel railroad tracks meeting at infinity. 

The basic idea is to `compactify' $\A^n$ by adding `points at infinity'. This is similar to the way $\R^1$ is compactified to $S^1$ or $\R^2$ to $S^2$. This is not at all apparent from the initial definition of porjective space, but will eventually become clear. 


Consider $\A^{n+1}$ with coordinates $x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n$. On $\A^{n+1} \setminus \{(0,\ldots,0)\}$, we define the following equivalence relation: $(a_0,\ldots,a_n) \sim (b_0,\ldots,b_n)$ if and only if there exists $\lambda \in k^\times$ such that $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)= (\lambda b_0,\ldots,\lambda b_n)$. The equivalence class of $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$ is the one-dimensional subspace of $\A^{n_1}$ spanned by $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$---minus the origin, which is the line through the origin and $(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$ minus the origin. 


\begin{dfn}
Projective $n$-space over $k$, denoted $\bP_k^n$ or $\bP^n(k)$ or $\bP= \A_k^{n+1} \setminus \{(0,\ldots,0)\}/\sim$. A point $P \in \bP$ is an equivalence class of some point $(a_0,\ldots,a_n) \in \A^{n+1} \setminus \{(0,\ldots,0)\}$ and is denoted $[a_0,\ldots,a_n]$. The $a_i$ are called the homogeneous coordinates of the point $P$. They are well defined up to a nonzero constant multiple. $\bP$ is also the set of lines through the origin in $k^{n+1}$, the set of one-dimensional subspaces of $k^{n+1}$. 
\end{dfn}



Denote the polynomial ring $k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ by $S$. For $f \in S$ and $O \in \bP^n$, $f(P)$ is not well defined because the coordinates of $P$ are not well defined. But suppose $f \in S$ is homogeneous: $f(\lambda a_0,\ldots, \lambda a_n) = \lambda^{\deg f} f(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$. $f(P)$ still not well defined since $\lambda \in k^\times$, whether $f(P)=0$ is well defined. So we define for a homogeneous $f \in S$, we define the zeros of $f$, denoted $Z(f)$ by $Z(f)= \{ P \in \bP^n \colon f(P)= 0\}.$ For a set of homogeneous elements $T \subseteq S$, we define the zeros of $T$, denoted $Z(T)$ by $Z(T)= \cap_{f \in I} Z(f)= \{P \in \bP^n \colon f(P)=0 \text{ for all }f \in T\}$. A set $Y \subseteq \bP^n$ is called algebraic if and only if $Y= Z(T)$ for some subset $T \subseteq S$ of homogeneous elements. If $I \subseteq S$ is a homogeneous ideal, we define $Z(I)= \{ P \in \bP^n \colon f(P)=0 \text{ for all homogeneous } f \in I\}= \cap_{f \in I, f homog} Z(f)$.


\begin{prop}
Let $T \subseteq S$ be a set of homogeneous elements, and let $I \subseteq S$ be the homogenous ideal generated by $T$. Then $Z(T)= Z(I)$. Thus, every algebraic set in $\bP^n$ is of the form $Z(I)$ for a homogeneous ideal and $Z(\{(f_1,\ldots,f_r)\})$ for finitely many homogeneous $f_i$, $Z(f_1,\ldots,f_r)$. 
\end{prop}


The algebraic subsets of $\bP^n$ satisfy the properties needed to be the closed subsets of a topology on $\bP^n$, it is the Zariski topology. 


\begin{dfn}
A projective algebraic variety (or simply projective variety) is an irreducible algebraic set in $\bP^n$, with the induced topology. An open subset of a projective variety is a quasi-projective variety. The dimension of a variety or quasi-projective variety is its dimension as a topological space. If $Y$ is any subset of $\bP^n$, we define the homogeneous ideal of $Y$ in $S$, denoted $I(Y)$, generated by $\{ f \in S \colon f \text{ homogeneous and } f(P)=0 \text{ for all }P \in Y\}$. If $Y$ is an algebraic set, we define the set of homogeneous coordinate ring of $Y$ to be $S(Y):= S/I(Y)$.
\end{dfn}


Note that $I(Y)$ is a homogeneous ideal so $S(Y)$ is a graded ring. These are similar to old algebraic sets with one funny difference. $S$ is clearly a homogeneous ideal of $S$. $Z(S)= \emptyset$, $S= k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ $(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$ is also clearly a homogeneous ideal of $S$. It is often called $S_+$ because it contains all homogeneous elements of positive degree $Z(S_+)= \emptyset$. This is the only thing which goes awry. $S_+$ is sometimes called the irrelevant maximal ideal since it removed from the correspondence we saw in the affine case. 


We now work on showing $\bP^n$ is $\A^{n+1}$ with points added at $\infty$. In $\bP^n$, consider closed sets of the form $Z(f)$ with $f$ a nonconstant polynomial These are called hypersurfaces. When $f$ is linear, it is called a hyperplane. Of particular interest is when $f= x_i$ for some $i$. Set $H_i= Z(x_i)= \{[a_0,\ldots,a_n] \;|\; a_i=0 \}$ and $U_i= \bP^n \setminus H_i$, $i=0,\ldots,n$, $U_i$ open. The $U_i$ are an open cover of $\bP^n$
	\[
	(\cup_i^n U_i)^C= \cap_0^n U_i^C= \cap_0^n H_i= \{[a_0,\ldots,a_N] \colon a_i= 0 \text{ all }i\}= \emptyset. 
	\]




























%%%%

$P= [a_0,\ldots,a_n] \in U_i$ if and only if $P= [a_0/a_i,\ldots,a_{i-1}/a_i,1,a_{i+1}/a_i,\ldots,a_n/a_i]$. Each point in $U_i$ has a unique set of homogeneous coordinates such that the $i$th coordinate is 1. Define a map $\phi_i: \A^n \to U_u$  by $\phi_i(a_1,\ldots,a_n)= [a_1,a_2,\ldots,1,\ldots,a_n]$. Moreover, this is clearly a bijection. 



\begin{prop}
The map $\phi_i$ is a homeomorphism of $U_i$ with its induced topology to $\A^n$ with its Zariski topology. 
\end{prop}

The proof is based on homogenization and dehomogenization of polynomials. To make notation simpler, we assume $i=0$. Let $S= k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$, $A= k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, and $S^h$ denote the homogeneous elements of $S$. There is a ring homomorphism $\alpha: S \to A$, defined as evaluation at $x_0= 1$: $\alpha(f(x_0,\ldots,x_n))= f(1,x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. Since $\alpha$ is a ring homomorphism
	\[
	\begin{split}
	\alpha(f+g)&= \alpha(f)+\alpha(g) \\
	\alpha(fg)&= \alpha(f)\alpha(g),
	\end{split}
	\]
called dehomogenization because even if $f$ is homogeneous, $\alpha(f)$ may not be: $\alpha(x_0^2+x_0x_1)= 1+x_1$. 


Homogenization: $\beta: A \to S^h$: $\beta(f(x_1,\ldots,x_n))= x_0^{\deg f} f(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0)$, $\beta(f)$ is homogeneous of degree $\deg f$. Look at a monomial of $f$: $x_1^{i_1} x_2^{i_2} \cdots x_n^{i_n}$, $i_1+\cdots+i_n \leq \deg f$.
	\[
	x_0^{\deg f} (x_1/x_0)^{i_1} \cdots (x_n/x_0)^{i_n}= x_0^{\deg f - (i_1+\cdots+i_n)} x_1^{i_1} \cdots x_n^{i_n}
	\]
has degree $\deg f$.


$\beta(fg)= \beta(f) \beta(g)$.
$\beta(fg)= x_0^{\deg f + \deg g} f(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0) g(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0)= x_0^{\deg f} f(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0) x_0^{\deg g} g(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0)= \beta(f) \beta(g)$. $\beta(f+g)$ might not equal $\beta(f) + \beta(g)$. 

If $\deg f \neq \deg g$, $\beta(f) + \beta(g)$ will not even be homogeneous. 

If $\deg f= \deg g= \deg(f+g)$, then $\beta(f+g)= \beta(f) + \beta(g)$. 
	\[
	\alpha(\beta(f))= \alpha(x_0^{\deg f} f(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0)= 1^{\deg f} f(x_1/x_0,\ldots,x_n/x_0)= f
	\]
$\beta(\alpha(f))= \beta(\alpha(x_0^l f))$. Assume you have a homogeneous $F$ that is not divisible by $x_0$.
	\[
	F= \sum a_{i_0 \cdots i_n} x_0^{i_0} \cdots x_n^{i_n}
	\]
where $i_0 + \cdots + i_n= d$. 


$\alpha(F)= \sum a_{i_0 \cdots i_n} x_1^{i_0} \cdots x_n^{i_n}$ and in at least one case $i_1+ \cdots + i_n = d$. 

$\beta(\alpha(F))= x_0^d a_{i_0 \cdots i_n} ((x_1/x_0)^{i_0} \cdots (x_n/x_0)^{i_n}= F$. Consider a point $(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \A^n$. $\phi_0(a_1,\ldots,a_n)= [1,a_1,\ldots,a_n] \in U_0 \subseteq \P^n$. 

$f \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$
$F \in k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ $F$ homogeneous
$f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)= 1^{\deg f} f(a_1/1,\ldots,a_n/1)= \beta(f)(1,a_1,\ldots,a_n)$.
$F(1,a_1,\ldots,a_n)= \alpha(F)(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$.
$f$ vanishes at $P \in \A^n$ if and only if $\beta(f)$ vanishes on $\phi_0(P) \in U_0$
$F$ vanishes at $\phi_0(P) \in U_0$ if and only if $\alpha(F)$ vanishes at $P \in \A^n$.

It is now easy to see that $\phi_0: \A^n \to U_0 \subseteq \P^n$ is a homeomorphism. 

Suppose $Y \subseteq \A^n$ is closed. $Y= Z(T)$, $T \subseteq k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. Set $\beta(T)= \{ \beta(f) \;|\; f \in T \}$, $\phi_0(Y)= Z(\beta(T)) \cap U_0$. 
$W \subseteq U_0$ closed in $U_0$
$W= U_0 \cap \overline{W}$, $\overline{W}$ closed in $\P^n$
$\overline{W}= Z(T)$, $T \subseteq S^h$
$\alpha(T)= \{ \alpha(F) \;|\; F \in T\}$
$\phi_0^{-1}(W)= Z(\alpha(T))$


\begin{cor}
If $Y$ is a projective (respectively quasi-projective) variety, then $Y$ is covered by the open sets $U_i \cap Y$, $i= 0,\ldots,n$, which are homeomorphic to affine (respectively quasi-affine) varieties with the map $\phi_i$. 
\end{cor}


$\A^n \cong U_i \subseteq \P^n$, $U_i= \P^n \setminus H_i$, $H_i= Z(x_i)= \{ [a_0,\ldots,0,\ldots,a_n \;|\; \text{not all }a_i=0 \} \cong \P^{n-1}$, $\P^n= \A^n \cup \P^{n-1}$. Parallel lines meet at infinity. 

%%% Ex


$\A^2$ coordinates $x,y$
$Ax+By+C=0$ at least one of $A,B \neq 0$.
$AB+Cy+D=0$, $C \neq D$.

Homogenize 
$Z(A(X/Z)+B(Y/Z)+C=0)$
$Ax+By+CZ=0-Ax+BY+DZ=0$ so $(C-D)Z=0$ so $Z=0$. 
If $Z=0$, still have $Ax+By= 0$. 

$x= \lambda B$, $y= -\lambda A$, $[\lambda B, -\lambda A,0]$ for $\lambda \neq 0$. One point in $\P^2$. $[B,-A,0]$ it is in $H_2$. $x_0 \iff x$, $x_1 \iff y$, $x_2 \iff z$.

Slope of $Ax+By+C=0$ is the ratio $-A/B$. So each slope determines what point at infinity the line goes to. 


%%% Ex

Looking at a curve in different patches and seeing how they fit together. 
Hyperbola: $xy-1=0$
homogeneize that $xy-z^2=0$
$z=1$, $xy-1=0$
$y=1$ $x-z^2=0$
$x=1$ $y-z^2=0$

% Give plots of hyperbola, plot and darken points (1,1), (-1,-1) and (1/2,2), (-1/2,-2)

$B(1/2,2), [1/2,2,1] $
$C[-1,-1,1], (-1,-1)$
$D[-1/2,-2,1], (-1/2,-2)$
$A[1,1,1],(1,1)$

$y- z^2$ (plot)
$E[1,0,0] (0,0)$
$A(1,1)[1,1,1]$
$B(4,2)[1/2,2,1]=[1,4,2]$
$C[-1,-1,1]=[1,1,-1]$
$D[-1/2,-2,1]=[1,4,-2]$

$x-z^2=0$ (plot)
$F(0,0)$
$A(1,1)[1,1,1]$
$B(1/4,1/2), [1/2,2,1]=[1/4,1,1/2]$
$C(1,-1)[-1,-1,1]= [1,1,-1]$
$D(1/4,-1/2)[-1/2,-2,1]=[1/4,1,-1/2]$



%%% Ex 2.12
$\rho_d(P)= [M_0(P), M_1(P), \ldots, M_N(P)]$
First note that the map is well defined.
$\rho_d([\lambda a_0,\ldots, \lambda a_n])= \lambda^d \rho_d([a_0,\ldots,a_n])$ because all of the $M_i$ are homogeneous of degree $d$. 

$f: \P^2 \to \P^2$
$f[(x_0,x_1,x_2])= [x_0x_1x_0x_2,x_0^2]$
$[0,0,1] \to [0,0,0]$, bad 

But not a problem above since one of $a_i$ is nonzero. The exercise asks you to check various things. $\rho_d$ is one-to-one, $\rho_d(\P^n)$ is a closed subset of $\P^N$, if we give $\rho_d(\P^n)$ its induced topology as a subset of $\P^N$ then $\rho_d: \P^n \to \rho_d(\P^n)$ is a homeomorphism. It seems reasonable to call it an embedding.

\begin{ex}
$n=1$, $d=2$
$[a_0,a_1] \mapsto [a_0^2,a_0a_1,a_1^2]$, labeled $X,Y,Z$. The image is contained in $Z(XZ-Y^2)$. In fact,.... \xqed
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Segre Embedding]
Let $\psi: \P^r \times \P^s \to \P^n$ be the map defined by sending the ordered pair $[a_0,\ldots,a_r] \times [b_0,\ldots,b_s] \mapsto [\ldots,a_ib_j,\ldots]$ all $a_ib_j$. $N= rs+r+s= (r+1)(s+1)-1$. This is well defined. $[\lambda a_0,\ldots,\lambda a_r] \times [\mu b_0,\ldots,\mu b_s]= \lambda \mu [\cdots a_ib_j \cdots]$. \xqed
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}
$\psi: \P^1 \times \P^1 \to \P^3$
$[a_0,a_1] \times [b_0,b_1] \mapsto [a_0b_0,a_0b_1,a_1b_0,a_1b_1]$ labeled $WXYZ$.
image lies on $WZ-XY=0$ in fact $=$. Book asks you to show $\psi$ is one-to-one and image is closed.  \xqed
\end{ex}


The book does not ask you to show that $\psi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image when you give the image the induced topology. Why? We have not defined the Zariski topology on $\P^r \times \P^s$. 

It is an exercise to show that if we identify $\A^2$ with $\A^1 \times \A^1$ in the natural way that the Zariski topology on $\A^2$ is not the product topology of the Zariski topologies on the two $\A^1$'s. Hint: In $\A^2$ with coordinates $x,y$, $Z(x-y)$ is closed in $\A^2$ with the Zariski topology, but not the product topology. 






















There are three ways to define the Zariski topology on $\P^r \times \P^s$. 

1) $\P^r$ is covered by $U_i$'s with the $U_i$ homeomorphic to $\A^r$. $\P^s$ is covered by $U_j$'s with each $U_j$ homeomorphic to $\A^s$. $\P^r \times \P^s$ will be covered by $U_i \times U_j$'s $\P^s$ is coverd by $U_j$'s with each $U_j$ homeomorphic to $\A^s$. $\P^r \times \P^s$ will be covered by $U_i \times U_j$'s. Give $U_i \times U_j$ the Zariski topology of $\A^{r+s}$, $U_i \times U_k \cap U_k \times U_l$. The topology induced from $U_i \times U_j$ is the same as the topology induced from $U_k \times U_l$. So you can glue to get a topology on $\P^r \times \P^s$. $X \subseteq \P^r \times \P^s$ closed if and only if $X \cap U_i \times U_j$ closed all $i,j$. 

2) on $\P^r$ take homogeneous coordinates $x_0,\ldots,x_r$ and on $\P^s$ take homogeneous coordinates $y_0,\ldots,y_s$. A polynomial $f \in k[x_0,\ldots,x_r,y_0,\ldots,y_s]$ is said to be bihomogeneous of bidegree $d,e$ if and only if every monomial of $f$ has degree $d$ in the $x_i$'s and degree $e$ in the $y_j$'s. In this case, $f(\lambda a_0,\ldots, \lambda a_r,\ldots,\mu b_0,\ldots,\mu b_r)= \lambda^d \mu^e f(a_0,\ldots,a_r,b_0,\ldots,b_r)$ whether $f$ vanishes on $(P,Q) \in \P^r \times \P^s$ is well defined. Define $Y \subseteq \P^r \times \P^s$ is closed if and only if $Y= Z(T)$ for some subset $T \subseteq k[x_0,\ldots,y_s]$ of bihomogeneous polynomials.


3) Give $\P^r \times \P^s$ the unique topology it must have for the Segre map $\psi: \P^r \times \P^s \to \psi(\P^r \times \P^s) \subseteq \P^N$ to be a homeomorphism when $\psi(\P^r \times \P^s)$ is given the induced topology as a subset of $\P^N$.

All three give the same topology. 

3 morphisms:

Note: any affine variety is also a quasi-affine variety. Same thing holds for projective and quasi-projective.

def: let $Y$ be a quasi-affine variety in $\A^n$. A function $f: Y \to k$ is regular at a point $P \in Y$ if and only if there is an open neighborhood $U$ with $P \in U \subseteq Y$ and polynomials $g,h \in A= k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $h$ is nowhere zero on $U$ and $f= g/h$ on $U$. We say that $f$ is regular on $Y$ if and only if it is regular at every point of $Y$.

``A function is regular if and only if it is locally a rational function.''

Note: It is important to remember this is not iff continuous does not imply regular. $f: \A^1 \to \A^1$ every bijection is continuous. 

Lemma 3.1: A regular function is continuous when $k$ is identified with $\A^1_k$ with its Zariski topology. 

\pf It is enough to show that $f^{-1}$ of closed is closed. $f^{-1}(\emptyset)= \emptyset$. Need $f^{-1}$ of finite sets closed. Since finite unions of closed are closed just need to show $f^{-1}$ of a point is closed. This can be checked locally: a subset $Z$ of a topological space $Y$ is closed if there exists an open cover of $Y$ such that $Z \cap U$ is closed in $U$ for every $U$ in cover. 

Let $U$ be an open set on which $f$ can be represented $f= g/h$, $g,h$ polynomials on $U$, $h \neq 0$. Such $U$ form open cover. $f^{-1}(a) \cap U= \{ P \in U \colon g(P)/h(P)= a \}$

$g(P)/h(P)=a$ if and only if $(g-ah)(p)=0$. that is closed. 


Functions on prijective spaces are more tricky. $P \in \P^n$, $f \in k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$. $f(P)$ is not well defined even if $f$ if homogeneous. $f,g \in k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ both continuous functions of the same degree $d$. also assume $g(P) \neq 0$. $P= [a_0,\ldots,a_n]$

	\[
	\dfrac{f(\lambda a_0,\ldots,\lambda a_n)}{g(\lambda a_0,\ldots,\lambda a_n)}= \dfrac{\lambda^d f(a_0,\ldots,a_n)}{\lambda^d g(a_0,\ldots,a_n)}= \dfrac{f(a_0,\ldots,a_n)}{g(a_0,\ldots,a_n)}.
	\]
Therefore, $f/g(P)$ is well defined. 


Def: Let $Y$ be a quasi projective variety in $\P^n$. A function $f: Y \to k$ is regular at a point $P \in Y$ iff there is an open neighborhood $Y$ with $P \in U \subseteq Y$ and homogeneous polynomials $g,h \in S= k[x_0,\ldots,x_n[$ of the same degree such that $h$ is nowhere zero on  $Y$ and $f=g/h$ on $Y$. We say $f$ is regular iff it is regular at every point. 


\begin{prop}
Let $Y \subseteq \P^n$ be a quasi-projective variety. $f: Y \to k$ a function. $P \in Y$ and assume $P \in U_i= \P^n \setminus Z(x_i)$. Then when we think of $U_i$ as $\A^n$, $Y \cap U_i$ is a quasi-affine variety and by restriction we get a function $f\big|_{Y \cap U_i}: Y \cap U_i \to k$. Then $f$ is regular at $P$ under the projective definition iff $f\big|_{Y \cap U_i}$ is regular at $P$ under the affine definition. 
\end{prop}

\pf Assume $f$ is regular at $P$ under the projective definition. Thus, we have an open set $U$ with $P \in U \subseteq Y$ and homogeneous polynomials $g,h \in S= k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ of the same degree such that $h$ is nowhere zero on $U$ and $f= g/h$ on $U$. On $U_0 \cap U$, which is open in $U_0 \cap Y$
	\[
	\dfrac{g(a_0,\ldots,a_n)}{h(a_0,\ldots,a_n)} = \dfrac{g(1,a_1/a_0,\ldots,a_n/a_0)}{h(1,a_1/a_0,\ldots,a_n/a_0)}.
	\]
But $g(1,x_1,\ldots,x_n) h(1,x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, $h \neq 0$ on $U_0 \cap Y$ so $f\big|_{U_0 \cap Y}$ is regular at $P$ under the affine defintion. 

Assume $f\big|_{U_0 \cap Y}$ is regular at $P$ under the affine definition. There is an open neighborhood $U$ with $P \in U \subseteq U_0 \cap Y$ and polynomials $g,h \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $h$ is nowhere zero on $U$ and $f= g/h$ on $U$. Note that $U$ is open in $Y$ not just $U_0 \cap Y$. Let $G$ and $H$ be the homogenizations of $g$ and $h$. If they do not have the same degree multiply the one of lower degree by an appropriate power of $x_0$ to make them both have the same degree. Now call them $\overline{G}, \overline{H}$. For any point $P= [1,a_1,\ldots,a_n] \in U$, 	\[
	f(P)= \dfrac{g(P)}{h(P)}= \dfrac{\overline{G}(1,a_1,\ldots,a_n)}{\overline{H}(1,a_1,\ldots,a_n)}= \dfrac{\overline{G}(\lambda, \lambda a_1,\ldots, \lambda a_n)}{\overline{H}(\lambda, \lambda a_1,\ldots, \lambda a_n)}
	\]
Fact: $X$ a variety $f,g$ regular functions on $X$. Suppose $f=g$ on some nonempty open $U \subseteq X$. Then $f=g$ on all $X$. Proof $Z(f-g)$ is closed in $X$ and since in an irreducible space nonempty opens are dense it is also dense. $Z(f-g)= X$. \qed \\


\begin{dfn}
Let $k$ be a fixed algebraically closed field. A variety over $k$ is an affine, quasi-affine, projective, or quasi-projective variety. If $X$ and $Y$ are two varieties, a morphism $\phi: X \to Y$ is a continuous map such that for every open $V \subseteq Y$ and for every regular function $f: V \to k$, the function $f \circ \varphi: \varphi^{-1}(V) \to k$ is regular. A morphism $\varphi: X  \to Y$ is a isomorphism if and only if there exists a morphism $\psi: Y \to X$ such that $\varphi \circ \psi= 1_Y$ and $\psi \circ \varphi= 1_X$. 
\end{dfn}


Note that an isomorphism is bijective and bicontinuous (hence a homeomorphism). The converse does not hold. There exists bijective bicontinuous function that are morphisms in one direction but not in the other. 


\begin{ex}
$X= \A_t^1$, $Y= Z(Y^2-X^3) \subseteq \A_{X,Y}^2$
$\varphi: X \to Y$, $\varphi(t)= (t^2,t^3)$
% Give picture
One can check that $\varphi$ is a morphism, one-to-one, onto, $\varphi^{-1}$ exists. Check that it is continuous. $\varphi^{-1}$ is not a morphism. There exists a regular function $f: X \to k$ such that $f \circ \varphi^{-1}: ? \to ?$ is not regular. $f$ is locally a rational function but $f \circ \varphi^{-1}$ is not. Problem at the cusp.
\end{ex}

Alternate definition of a morphism: 

\begin{prop}
Let $X \subseteq \P^n$ and $Y \subseteq \P^m$ be quasi-projective varieties and $f: X \to Y$ a function. Then $f$ is a morphism if and only if the following condition is satisfied: given any $P \in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $P$, $P \in U \subseteq X$, such that $f(U)$ is contained in one of the affine opens $U_i \subseteq \P^m$. 
\end{prop}

Denote this set by $U_0$. Now think of $f: U \to \A^m$. We require further that there exist $m$ regular functions $g_i: U \to k$ such that for all $Q \in U$
	\[
	f(Q)= (g_1(Q),\ldots, g_m(Q))
	\]
Further since regular functions are locally rational by shrinking $U$, you may assume each $g_i$ is a rational function.


A morphism is a function locally given by tuples of rational functions. We have shown polynomials are continuous in the Zariski topology. Easily follows rational function are continuous where defined. A composition of rational functions is rational.

\begin{ex}
Consider the Veronese $\nu: \P^2 \to \P^2$ given by $\nu([x_0,x_1])= [x_0^2,x_0x_1,x_1^2]$. It is a morphism. $y \mapsto (y,y^2)$. On $U_0 \subseteq \P^1$, $\nu(U_0) \subseteq U_0'$
	\[
	U(1,x_1/x_0)= [1,x_1/x_0, (x_1/x_0)^2]
	\]
$U_1 \subseteq \P^1$, $\nu(U_1) \subseteq U_2'$
$\nu(x_0/x_1,1)= [(x_0/x)^2,x_0/x,1]$
$\nu(y)= [y^2,y]$.
\end{ex}


Let $X \subseteq \P^n$ and $Y \subseteq \P^m$ be quasi-projective varieties and $f: X \to Y$ be a function. Then $f$ is a morphism if and only if the following condition is satisfied: given any $P \in X$, there is an open neighborhood $U$ of $P$. $P \in U \subseteq X$ and $m$ polynomials. $F_0,\ldots,F_m \in k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ all homogeneous of the same degree such that for all $Q \in U$, $f(Q)= [F_0(Q), F_1(Q), \ldots, F_m(Q)]$. 


\begin{ex}
We can find the inverse of the Veronese embedding. $\nu: \P^1 \to \P^2$
$\nu([x_0,x_1])= px_0^2,x_0x_1,x_1^2]$ labeled $(Y_0,Y_1Y_2)$
On $U_0 \subseteq \P^2$, 
$\nu^{-1}[Y_0,Y_1,Y_2]= [Y_0,Y_1]$
On $U_2 \cap \nu(\P^1) \subseteq \P^2$
$\nu^{-1}[Y_0,Y_1,Y_2]= [Y_1,Y_2]$
$U_0$ and $U_2$ cover $\nu(\P^1)$

$U_0$: $[x_0,x_1] \mapsto [x_0,x_0x_1,x_1^2] \mapsto [x_0^2,x_0x_1]= [x_0,x_1]$ since $x_0 \neq 0$. 

$U_1$: $[x_0,x_1] \mapsto [x_0,x_0,x_1,x_1^2] \mapsto [x_0x_1,x_1^2]= [x_0,x_1]$ since $x_1 \neq 0$. 


No the other way:

$U_0$: $[Y_0,Y_1,Y_2] \mapsto [Y_0,Y_1] \mapsto [Y_0^2,Y_0Y_1,Y_1^2]$ only working on $\nu(\P^1)$, $Y_0Y_2= Y_1^2$
$[Y_0^2,Y_0Y_1,Y_0Y_2]= [Y_0,Y_1,Y_2]$

$U_1$: $[Y_0,Y_1,Y_2] \to [Y_1,Y_2] \to [Y_1^2,Y_1Y_2,Y_2^2]= [Y_0Y_2,Y_1Y_2,Y_2^2]= [Y_0,Y_1,Y_2]$ since $Y_2 \neq 0$. 

$\nu(\P^1) \cap U_0 \cap U_2$ on $\P^2$
$[Y_0,Y_1,Y_2] \to [Y_0,Y_1]= [Y_0Y_2,Y_1,Y_2]= [Y_1^2,Y_1Y_2] = [Y_1,Y_2]$ using $Y_0Y_2=Y_1^2$. 
\end{ex}


\begin{dfn}
Let $Y$ be a variety. We denote by $\cO(Y)$ the ring of all regular functions on $Y$. If $P$ is a point of $Y$, we define the local ring of $P$ on $Y$, $\cO_{P,Y}$ (or simply $\cO_P$) to be the ring of germs of regular functions on $Y$ near $P$: equivalence classes of pairs $\langle U,f \rangle$, where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $P$ in $Y$ and $f$ is a regular function on $U$ with the equivalence relation $\langle U,f \rangle \sim \langle V,g \rangle \Leftrightarrow f=g \text{ on } U \cap V$.
\end{dfn}

	\[
	\begin{split}
	\langle U,f \rangle + \langle V,g \rangle&= \langle U \cap V, f+g \rangle \\
	\langle U,f \rangle \langle V,g \rangle&= \langle U \cap V, fg \rangle 
	\end{split}
	\]
Of course, there much to check here. Use the fact that $Y$ is a variety (hence irreducible)
